Pre-configured template for Java development, containing the following basic components:
1. a Java project skeleton using Bazel
2. The necessary CI workflows which defines the skeleton for tests, distribution tests, and release deployments

# Requirements
- Java
- CircleCI accounts
- Bazel
  - (optional) Remote Build Execution credential set up in CircleCI
- (optional) [IntelliJ IDEA Bazel plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8609-bazel)

# Usage
## Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lolski/project-template-java.git
cd project-template-java
```

## Building
Building and running the template:
```
bazel build //:distribution
cd bazel-genfiles/
unzip project-template-java.zip
cd project-template-java/
./run
```

## Testing
Running tests locally:
```
bazel test //...
```

Running tests with Remote Build Execution:
```
bazel test //... --config=rbe
```

## Adding Maven Dependencies
1. Add the Maven coordinate into `dependencies/maven/dependencies.yaml`
2. Run `./dependencies/maven/update.sh`. If successful, you can expect output that looks like this:
```
./dependencies/maven/update.sh 
INFO: Invocation ID: fce83792-4f71-4f72-b24f-64bf9aa4e4fe
INFO: Build options have changed, discarding analysis cache.
INFO: Analysed target //dependencies/tools:bazel-deps (16 packages loaded, 463 targets configured).

```

# Troubleshooting
**Error about "bazel does not currently work properly from paths containing spaces":**
```
bazel build //:distribution
ERROR: bazel does not currently work properly from paths containing spaces (com.google.devtools.build.lib.runtime.BlazeWorkspace@4a053256).
```

Do a `pwd` and make sure your project isn't in a path which contains whitespace like this:
```
$ pwd
/home/martin/bazel project
```

**Error about "Unrecognized VM option" on a Mac machine**:
```
$ bazel build //:distribution

```

  1. Make sure to update to the latest Java
  2. If `bazel version` returns something like `0.20.0-homebrew` rather than `0.20.0`, you're not using the right Bazel. Make Make sure you install the one from `bazelbuild/tap`. : https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-os-x.html
